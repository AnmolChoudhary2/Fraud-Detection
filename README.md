# Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on analyzing transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity. The goal is to develop models and techniques to detect and prevent fraud in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.

**Project Overview**

* **Goal:** Build a system that effectively identifies fraudulent transactions within a dataset of transaction records.
* **Dataset:**  The project will utilize a transaction dataset containing features like:
    * Transaction amount
    * Merchant category code (MCC)
    * Time of day
    * Location
    * Customer ID
    * Product/service details
* **Approach:** The project will explore various machine learning and statistical techniques to identify fraudulent patterns, including:
    * Supervised learning (classification, regression)
    * Unsupervised learning (anomaly detection, clustering)
    * Rule-based systems 
    * Hybrid approaches
    * NLP

**Methodology**

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   * Analyze the transaction data to understand its structure, distribution of variables, and potential missing values.
   * Handle missing data and outliers.
   * Engineer new features that may be relevant for fraud detection (e.g., transaction frequency, average spending patterns).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualize and analyze the data to uncover hidden patterns or relationships that might indicate fraud.
   * Identify potential correlations between variables and fraudulent behavior.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Create new features that capture temporal patterns, spending habits, and other characteristics that differentiate fraudulent from legitimate transactions.
   * Consider using techniques like time series analysis and aggregation to derive meaningful features.

4. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised.
   * Train models on labeled data (if available) or use anomaly detection techniques for unlabeled data.
   * Fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Assess model performance using relevant metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
   * Pay close attention to the false positive rate (incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions as fraud) and false negative rate (failing to detect fraudulent transactions).

6. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
   * (Optional) Integrate the model into a production environment to monitor transactions in real time or near-real time.
   * Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as new data becomes available.
